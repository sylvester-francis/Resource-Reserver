# Reservations

Reservations are time-based bookings against a resource.

## Create a reservation

1. Pick a resource (you can reserve resources that are currently in use for a future time slot)
2. Select start and end time
3. Confirm the booking

If the slot conflicts with an existing reservation, the API responds with a conflict error. You can adjust the time or join the waitlist.

## Recurring reservations

You can create recurring reservations for repeating schedules.

## View and manage

- View your reservations in the Reservations tab
- Cancel your own reservations (click the red "Cancel" button)
- Reservations can only be cancelled if they haven't started yet
- Review reservation history for audit purposes

## Cancellation

- **Your reservations**: You can cancel any of your active reservations that haven't started
- **Admin cancellation**: Administrators can cancel any user's reservation if needed
