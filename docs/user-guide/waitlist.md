# Waitlist

If a resource is fully booked, you can join the waitlist for a desired time window.

## How it works

- Join the waitlist for a resource and time range
- When a slot opens, you receive an offer
- Offers expire after 30 minutes

## Actions

- Accept an offer to create a reservation
- Leave the waitlist if you no longer need the slot
